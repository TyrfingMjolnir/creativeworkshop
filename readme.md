This app is an outline of an old school demoscene demo with music and generated graphics. It's meant for using with a creative code workshop.

## Getting started

The app is using a plugin called Browser sync | https://www.browsersync.io/ | and opens both a local instance on :8080 and a public address for testing on different platforms of collaborating wit others.
